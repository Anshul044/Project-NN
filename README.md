Unlike other emotion detection models, these techniques consider the party-states and inter-party dependencies for modeling conversational context relevant to emotion recognition. The primary purpose of all these techniques are to pretrain an emotion detection model for empathetic dialogue generation.

Emotion recognition can be very useful for empathetic and affective dialogue generation -

## Data Format

These networks expect emotion/sentiment label and speaker info for each utterance present in a dialogue like
```
Party 1: I hate my girlfriend (angry)
Party 2: you got a girlfriend?! (surprise)
Party 1: yes (angry)
```
However, the code can be adpated to perform tasks where only the preceding utterances are available, without their corresponding labels, as context and goal is to label only the present/target utterance. For example, the *context* is
```
Party 1: I hate my girlfriend
Party 2: you got a girlfriend?!
```
the *target* is
```
Party 1: yes (angry)
```
where the target emotion is _angry_.
Moreover, this code can also be molded to train the network in an end-to-end manner. We will soon push these useful changes.

## COSMIC: COmmonSense knowledge for eMotion Identification in Conversations

[_COSMIC_](https://github.com/declare-lab/conv-emotion) addresses the task of utterance level emotion recognition in conversations using commonsense knowledge. It is a new framework that incorporates different elements of commonsense such as mental states, events, and causal relations, and build upon them to learn interactions between interlocutors participating in a conversation. Current state-of-the-art methods often encounter difficulties in context propagation, emotion shift detection, and differentiating between related emotion classes. By learning distinct commonsense representations, COSMIC addresses these challenges and achieves new state-of-the-art results for emotion recognition on four different benchmark conversational datasets.

### Execution

First download the RoBERTa and COMET features [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TQYQYCoPtdXN2rQ1mR2jisjUztmOzfZr/view?usp=sharing) and keep them in appropriate directories in `COSMIC/erc-training`. Then training and evaluation on the four datasets are to be done as follows:

1. IEMOCAP: `python train_iemocap.py --active-listener`
2. DailyDialog: `python train_dailydialog.py --active-listener --class-weight --residual`
3. MELD Emotion: `python train_meld.py --active-listener --attention simple --dropout 0.5 --rec_dropout 0.3 --lr 0.0001 --mode1 2 --classify emotion --mu 0 --l2 0.00003 --epochs 60`
4. MELD Sentiment: `python train_meld.py --active-listener --class-weight --residual --classify sentiment`
5. EmoryNLP Emotion: `python train_emorynlp.py --active-listener --class-weight --residual`
6. EmoryNLP Sentiment: `python train_emorynlp.py --active-listener --class-weight --residual --classify sentiment`

## TL-ERC: Emotion Recognition in Conversations with Transfer Learning from Generative Conversation Modeling

[_TL-ERC_](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.04980.pdf) is a transfer learning-based framework for ERC. It pre-trains a generative dialogue model and transfers context-level weights that include affective knowledge into the target discriminative model for ERC.

<p align="center">
  <img src="TL-ERC.jpg" alt="TL-ERC framework" width="600"/>
</p>

### Setting up

1. Setup an environment with Conda:

    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate TL_ERC
    cd TL_ERC
    python setup.py
    ```
2. Download dataset files [IEMOCAP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nufbrBJ-LtcROv1MviCHFI7tQE3JnqQR/view?usp=sharing), [DailyDialog](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13rHLtAMmDsiCP1hZwWqMNcrtkmZF_hK3/view?usp=sharing) and store them in `./datasets/`.

3. Download the pre-trained weights of HRED on [Cornell](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OXtnyJ5nDMmK75L9kEQvKPIyO0xzyeVC/view?usp=sharing) and [Ubuntu](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T2HLfSvWr7CSrhBuE193XRRXwfLkO_aK/view?usp=sharing) datasets and store them in `./generative_weights/`

4. [Optional]: To train new generative weights from dialogue models, refer to https://github.com/ctr4si/A-Hierarchical-Latent-Structure-for-Variational-Conversation-Modeling . 


### Run the ERC classifier with pre-trained weights

1. `cd bert_model`
2. `python train.py --load_checkpoint=../generative_weights/cornell_weights.pkl --data=iemocap`.   
    -  Change `cornell` to `ubuntu` and `iemocap` to `dailydialog` for other dataset combinations.
    -  Drop `load_checkpoint` to avoid initializing contextual weights.
    -  To modify hyperparameters, check `configs.py`

### [Optional] Create ERC Dataset splits

1. Set [glove](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip) path in the preprocessing files.
2. `python iemocap_preprocess.py`. Similarly for `dailydialog`.

## DialogueGCN: A Graph Convolutional Neural Network for Emotion Recognition in Conversation

[_DialogueGCN_](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.11540.pdf) (Dialogue Graph Convolutional Network), is a graph neural network based approach to ERC. We leverage self and inter-speaker dependency of the interlocutors to model conversational context for emotion recognition. Through the graph network, DialogueGCN addresses context propagation issues present in the current RNN-based methods. DialogueGCN is naturally suited for multi-party dialogues.

## DialogueRNN: An Attentive RNN for Emotion Detection in Conversations

[_DialogueRNN_](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00405.pdf) is basically a customized recurrent neural network (RNN) that
profiles each speaker in a conversation/dialogue on the fly, while models the
context of the conversation at the same time. This model can easily be extended to
multi-party scenario. Also, it can be used as a pretraining model for empathetic
dialogue generation. 

__Note__: the default settings (hyperparameters and commandline arguments) in the code are meant for BiDialogueRNN+Att. The user needs to optimize the settings for other the variants and changes.

## ICON

Interactive COnversational memory Network (ICON) is a multimodal emotion detection framework that extracts multimodal features from conversational videos and hierarchically models the \textit{self-} and \textit{inter-speaker} emotional influences into global memories. Such memories generate contextual summaries which aid in predicting the emotional orientation of utterance-videos.

## bc-LSTM-pytorch
[_bc-LSTM-pytorch_](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1081) is a network for using context to detection emotion of an utterance in a dialogue. The model is simple but efficient which only uses a LSTM to model the temporal relation among the utterances. In this repo we gave the data of Semeval 2019 Task 3. We have used and provided the data released by Semeval 2019 Task 3 - "Emotion Recognition in Context" organizers. In this task only 3 utterances have been provided - utterance1 (user1), utterance2 (user2), utterance3 (user1) consecutively. The task is to predict the emotion label of utterance3. Emotion label of each utterance have not been provided. However, if your data contains emotion label of each utterance then you can still use this code and adapt it accordingly. Hence, this code is still aplicable for the datasets like MOSI, MOSEI, IEMOCAP, AVEC, DailyDialogue etc. bc-LSTM does not make use of speaker information like CMN, ICON and DialogueRNN.
